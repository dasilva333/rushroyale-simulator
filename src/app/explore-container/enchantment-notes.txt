i came up with some numbers to show how the text for battle thrill enchantment is wrong

so i took this deck as my base deck
inquis scrapper trapper ks dryad
player crit: 2909
this is the base damage for that deck given all my other stuff: 2,011,388

these are straight forward and easy to calculate because it's just speed or damage increase
wrath - 2,212,527 (9% buff)
wrath 2 - 2,313,096 (13% buff)
gust - 2,054,551 (2.1% buff)

then there's battle thrill and the misleading text it says "increase the crit damage of a unit" but it doesn't say how.

assuming it's critical chance (unlikely bc 24% buff would be unbalanced)
battle thrill - 2,202,116 (8.6% buff)
battle thrill 2 - 2,647,147 (24% buff)

assuming it's 10% added to player critical damage (2909 + 10) (this is what the text would lead you to believe but it cant be this small of a buff)
battle thrill - 2,013,237 (0.0001% buff)
battle thrill 2 - 2,017,551 (0.003% buff)

assuming it's 10% multiplied by the player's critical damage (2909 x 1.1) (this one seems most reasonable and inline with the other buffs)
battle thrill - 2,065,173 (2.6% buff)
battle thrill 2 - 2,190,672 (8.1% buff)

if it's this one 2909 x 1.1 then the would be does it do (2909 + bow buff) x 1.1 or (2909 x 1.1) + bow buff
