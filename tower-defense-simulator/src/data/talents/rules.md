does this talent affect the stats? 
no - then there's no extra fields
yes:
    is the condition set by the board or by a scenario?
    board: no extra fields because board conditions can be automatically calculated (like number of units)
    scenario: 
        is the scenario true/false (something is activated) based or numeric based (number of souls)?
        true/false: extra fields checkbox
        numeric: input box
